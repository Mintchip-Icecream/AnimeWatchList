This is a chrome extension that tracks anime, you can either enter in the name of an anime and press "enter" to generate a bookmark, or click the "Generate Bookmark" button to bookmark a show while you're on its MyAnimeList page, or while you're actively watching an anime (currently feature only available on miruro.tv). 
This was made to learn javascript, so it's a bit unpolished right now. It uses the Jikan API for handling searches to anime, so if you enter in the name or use the bookmark button while watching the anime, it uses the search function in the API using the title of the anime. This works fine on most anime, and anime where the seasons have different names, but for shows like One Piece or Gintama with several movies or seasons with near identical names as the source, you might not get the anime you're thinking of when you make the bookmark, so just go on MyAnimeList because MAL has dedicated ID numbers for each anime, so you'll be 100% correct when generating a bookmark on the MAL page of whatever anime you want to bookmark.
